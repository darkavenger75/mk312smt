Please find the files required for PCB production and assembly here.
Do not forget the components (e.g. buttons and display) for the top side of the control PCB.
V1.3 Front Panel has a bit smaller cutout for the display, leaving less a gap. A display with outer dimensions 24*71 mm fits. There are slightly larger displays, e.g. from Newhaven which are 26.5 mm high. Use version V1.3L for those.
